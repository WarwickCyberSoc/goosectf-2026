## Overview
A challenge that involves using a series of ciphers in a row on the provided ciphertext

## Description
I'm friends with a mirror-enthusiast. He recently told me that he's going on a trip to solve a trivia question that intrigued him. 

He will be starting his journey in Cassis. He will then head to Le Détroit, listening to a cassette on the way. Once he leaves Le Détroit, he will head to Versailles, however he is excited as he thinks he will encounter a mirror on the trip between Le Détroit and Versailles. He also told me he will look at a mirror just before he leaves to begin his journey.

I asked him what this trivia question was and why he even needs to go to France. Instead of answering, he bet me that I couldn't solve it before him and handed me a map of his planned journey (see the attached file). He then gave me a piece of paper which supposedly contained the question. It read as follow:

?/41/41/52/81/ /12/81/6/ /31/8/ /4/71/4/22 51/41/11/41/41/5/9/ /12/01/32/9/ /91/11/4

,/7/7/22/81/ /62/3/51/ /9/01 rorriM ,rorriM

Help me find the answer without visiting France - I'm too busy with coursework for a holiday :(

The flag is the answer in digits only. For example, if the answer was twelve, the flag would be GooseCTF{12}.
