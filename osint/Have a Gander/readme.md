## Overview
OSINT challenge to find a goose statue in Nottingham.

## Description
I leant Oscar my goose statue when he was travelling, so he could see the world! Unfortunately, he never made it further than somewhere near Loughborough, when he was stolen by hooligans while Oscar was napping! I think I saw a photo of my Goosey the other day - maybe I should speak to the photographer? Can you find their instagram handle so I can contact them?
