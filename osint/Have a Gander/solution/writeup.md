# Have a Gander

Looking at a map, the nearest significant places to Loughborough are Nottingham, and Leicester. A quick google will reveal a big goose statue in Nottingham - and it even looks like the CyberSoc logo!

[Goosey | Visit Nottinghamshire](https://www.visit-nottinghamshire.co.uk/things-to-do/goosey-the-goose-fair-goose-p586881)

If it doesn't yield that page directly, you may find out about Nottingham's Goose Fair - which should hopefully lead you to find out about Goosey!

On the Visit Nottinghamshire page, there is a credit to the photographer.

If you google for the name of the photographer along with "photography", his instagram was quite near the top. Perfect!

Then you just need to submit the flag.
